***📋 Overview***
-
My SQL project explores database solutions using MySQL for managing complex healthcare operations, tackling three modern major challenges:

1. Patient Care Workflows = Tracks patient admissions, appointments, treatments, and medical histories in real-time to reduce wait times and improve care coordination.
2. Resource Allocation = Manages doctors, nurses, equipment, and room assignments to maximize utilization and minimize operational bottlenecks.
3. Financial Operations = Monitors billing, insurance claims, and payment processing to reduce revenue leakage and improve cash flow.

**Why It Matters:** Hospitals struggle with fragmented data systems that lead to scheduling conflicts, unused resources, and billing errors costing millions annually. I hope this database acts as a centralized backbone example, giving administrators clear visibility into operations so they can make better decisions that directly impact outcomes.

***⛁ Database Architecture***
-
**📂 Core Modules:**
- Patient Management: Complete demographics, medical records, and insurance information.
- Appointment Scheduling: A collaborative department scheduling system with status tracking.
- Staff management includes personnel data, department duties, and performance indicators
- Billing & Insurance: Financial transactions, insurance claims, and payment tracking.
- Ward/Bed Management: Real-time bed occupancy and patient admission procedures.
- Inventory Management: Track medical supplies with automated reorder alerts.

**📊 Statistics:**

- 13 Interconnected Tables
- 300 Patient Records
- 500 Staff Members (Doctors, Nurses, Administrative Staff, Technicians)
- 2,000 Appointments
- 10,000 Medical History Records
- 7,000 Prescriptions
- 340 Hospital Beds across 12 wards
- ~2,000 Billing Transactions
